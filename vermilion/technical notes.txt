To do:

* Replace the networking-event system with one that only sends network events to the extension that registered the network string
* Replace the multi-string networking with an internal networking system. This means that Vermilion will only send one network string back and forth, but there will be multiple commands (currently the network strings) that indicate the type of message. This will also require the messages to be generated by functions.



Important notes:

* Do not attempt to merge the autorun scripts. They will:
	a) cause gmod to hang indefintely
	b) In the unlikely event that gmod does load, will fail to start Vermilion
